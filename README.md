# Maximum-Palindromes


Hannah provides a string consisting of lowercase English letters. Every day, for q days, she would select two integers l and r, take the substring and ask the following question:

Consider all the palindromes that can be constructed from some of the letters from s(l..r). You can reorder the letters as you need. Some of these palindromes have the maximum length among all these palindromes. How many maximum-length palindromes are there?
